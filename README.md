# Abraham-sandbox

General collection of code for making art with machine learning, with an API written on top of it to combine modules. 

This repo does not implement any features toward security, privacy, or decentralization, and should be considered a testing ground for Abraham's art generator. A different repo for an MVP will be initialized later. 

This is a work-in-progress. More documentation will be added soon.

### Setup

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/abraham-ai/abraham
    cd abraham
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Downloading models

TBD
